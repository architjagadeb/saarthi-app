      <h2>When Silence Becomes a Barrier</h2>
      <p>Across rural India, menstruation is rarely spoken about openly. Cultural taboos and myths lead to shame, school dropouts, and even serious health issues. This campaign began with one woman’s voice—an ASHA worker who began educating girls using Murf AI-generated regional audio. That one message sparked conversations in classrooms, temples, and village gatherings.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission & Vision</h2>
      <p>We aim to dismantle the stigma around menstruation by sparking open, honest, and accurate conversations. Through Murf AI, Saarthi produces multilingual voice messages that explain menstruation, hygiene, and the use of affordable sanitary products. These messages are shared via WhatsApp, loudspeakers, and school programs — ensuring every girl hears that her body is nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
