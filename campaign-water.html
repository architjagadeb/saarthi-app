      <h2>A Ripple That Became a Wave</h2>
      <p>In many villages, access to safe drinking water is still a dream. Contaminated sources lead to diseases, yet the awareness around purification and storage is dangerously low. Saarthi launched this campaign after a voice message on water-borne diseases went viral in Jharkhand. That single ripple triggered water audits, filter distributions, and better storage practices in nearby districts.</p>

      <h2>Making Every Drop Count</h2>
      <p>Using Murf AI, we produce educational content on identifying clean water sources, low-cost filtration methods, and community-level water storage solutions — all in the local language. These messages are spread via mobile phones, village noticeboards, and temple announcements, ensuring even the remotest families receive the knowledge they need to stay safe.</p>

      <h2>You Can Turn the Tide</h2>
      <p>Your voice matters. Whether you start a campaign in your village, fund a water-purification drive, or simply share an audio message with a friend — you become part of a movement that prioritizes health, dignity, and access. Together, we can quench more than thirst — we can bring awareness, action, and change.</p>
